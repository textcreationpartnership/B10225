            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe work which I am at this time called unto in this place (as upon a publick Theater) is to Die, and receive a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge once for all, out of priſon, to doe that which is but once to be done; and the doing or not doing of which <hi>well</hi> and as becomes a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> does much depend upon the life we have been taught of God to lead before we come to this: they that live in the faith, do alſo die in it; Faith is ſo farre from leaving them in this houre, that the work of it breaks forth then into its greateſt power, as if till then it were not enough at freedome to doe its office, that is, to look into the things that are unſeen with moſt ſtedfaſtneſs, certainty, and delight, which is the great ſweetner of death, and remover of its ſting.</p>
            <p>Give me leave therefore in a very few words, to give you an account of my life, and of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full great grace and mercy of God in bringing me home to himſelf, and revealing his Sonne in me, that by the knowledge of the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, I might even whilſt here in the body be made pertaker of eternall life in the firſt fruits of it, and at laſt ſit down with Chriſt in glory at his right hand.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:180687:4"/>
            <p>Here to mention ſome remarkable paſſages and changes of my life.</p>
            <p>And in particular, how unſought by my ſelf I was called to be a member of the long Parliament; what little advantage I had by it, and by what ſteps I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſatisfied with the Cauſe I was engaged in, and d d purſue the ſame: what the Cauſe was did firſt ſhew it ſelf in the firſt Remonſtrance of the houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the more refined purſuit of it by the Commons houſe in their actings ſingle, with what reſult they were growing up, into was in the breaſt of the Houſe and unknown; or what the three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals mentioned in my charge would have been at laſt, I ſhall not need now to repeat them. But onely from all parts together to aſſert that this Cauſe which was owned by the Parliament, was the Cauſe of God, and for the promoting of the kingdome of his deare Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, wherein is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our liberties and duties both as men and as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>And ſince it pleaſed God who ſeparated me from the womb to the knowledge and ſervice of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of his Sonne, to ſeparate me alſo to this hard and difficult ſervice at this time, and to ſingle me out to the defence and juſtification of his Cauſe, I could not conſent by any words or actions of mine, that the innocent blood that hath been ſhed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it throughout the whole warre (<hi>the guilt and morrall evils of which muſt certainly lye ſomewhere</hi>) did lye at my door or at theirs that have been the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180687:2"/> adhearents to this cauſe, which is with ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon my heart that I am moſt freely and chearfully willing to put the greateſt Seal to it I am capable, which is the powring out of my very blood in witneſs to it, which is all I ſhall need to ſay in this place and at this time, having ſpoken at large to it in my defence at my Trials and had intended to ſay more the laſt day, as what I thought was reaſonable for the arreſt of the judgement, though I was not permitted then to ſpeake it. Both which may with time and Gods providence come to light.</p>
            <p>And I muſt ſtill aſſert, that I remain wholly unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that the courſe of proceedings againſt me at my tryall were according to Law, but that I was run upon and deſtroyed contrary to right, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> under the form of Juſtice: which I leave to God to decide who is the Judge of the whole world, and to clear my innocency. Whileſt in the mean time I beſeech him to forgive them, and all that have had a hand in my death; and that the Lord in his great mercy will not lay it unto their charge.</p>
            <p>And I doe account this lot of mine no other then what is to be expected by thoſe that are not of the world, but whom Chriſt hath choſen out of it; for the ſervant is not greater then his Lord, and if they have done this to the green tree, they will doe it much more to the dry.</p>
            <p>However I ſhall not altogether excuſe my ſelf, I know that by many weakneſſes and failings. I have given occaſion enough of the ill uſage I have met with from men, though in the main the Lord knows
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180687:3"/> the ſincerity and integrity of my heart, whatever aſperſions and reproaches I have or do lye under.</p>
            <p>I know alſo that God is juſt in bringing this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and condemnation upon me for my ſins, there is a body of ſinne and death in me deſerves this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And there is a ſimil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tude and likeneſs alſo, that as a Chriſtian God thinks me worthy to beare with my Lord and head in many circumſtances in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference to theſe dealings <hi>I</hi> have met with, in the good <hi>I</hi> have been endeavouring for many years to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Nations, and eſpecially now at the laſt in being numbred amongſt tranſgreſſors, and made a publick ſacrifice through the wrath and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men. And having finiſhed my courſe, and fought the good fight of faith, and reſiſted in a way of ſuffering (as you ſee) even unto blood.</p>
            <p>This is but the needfull preparation the Lord hath been working in me to the receiving the Crown of immortality which he hath prepared for them that love him. The proſpect whereof is ſo chearfull that through the joy (in it) that is ſet before the eyes of my faith, I can through mercy endure this croſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe this ſhame, and am become more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour through Chriſt that hath loved me.</p>
            <p>For my Life and Eſtate, all is not ſo dear to me as my ſervice to God, to his Cauſe, to the Kingdome of Chriſt, and the future wellfare of my Countrey; and I am taught according to the example, as well as that moſt Chriſtian ſaying of a <hi>Noble Perſon that lately dyed after this publick manner in Scotland,</hi> How much better it is to chuſe Affliction and the Croſſe, then to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180687:4"/> ſinne or draw back from the ſervice of the Living God into wayes of Apoſtacy and Perdition.</p>
            <p>That Noble Perſon whoſe Memory I Honour, was with my ſelf at the beginning and making of the <hi>Solemne League and Covenant,</hi> the matter of which and the holy ends therein contained, I fully aſſent unto and have been as deſirous to obſerve; but the Rigid way of proſecuteing it, and oppreſſing unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that hath been endeavoured by it, I never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>This were ſufficient to vindicate me from the falſe Aſperſions and Calumnies which have been laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me of Jeſuitiſme and Popery, and almoſt what not to make my name of ill Savour with <hi>good men,</hi> which dark miſts do now diſpell of themſelves, or at leaſt ought, and need no pains of mine in making an Apology.</p>
            <p>For if any man ſeek a proof of Chriſt in me, let him read it in this action of my Death, which will not ceaſe to ſpeak when I am gone; and henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not deſire in this place to take up much time, but only as my laſt words leave with you: That as the preſent ſtorme we now lie under, and the dark Clouds that yet hang over the Reformed Churches of Chriſt, which are comming thicker and thicker for a ſeaſon, were not un-fore-ſeen by me for many years paſſed, as ſome writings of mine declare.</p>
            <p>So the coming of Chriſt in theſe Clouds in order
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180687:5"/> to a ſpeedy and ſudden revivall of his Cauſe, and ſpreading his Kingdome over the face of the whole Earth is moſt clear to the eye of my Faith, in that Faith in which I Dye, whereby the Kingdome of this world ſhall become the Kingdome of our Lord and of his Chriſt, Amen. Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</p>
